# Email Signatures

*Created by Elijah Luckey.*

This is just a fun little project that I'm completing to add awesome email signatures to all my email accounts. Feel free to take whatever you'd like to use. I will be posting screenshots shortly.

Just copy and paste the signature you would like to use. Currently [`generic_signature`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luckey-Elijah/email_signatures/master/generic_signature.html) and [`student_signature`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luckey-Elijah/email_signatures/master/student_signature.html) are in HTML format. The `student_signature` uses [Font Awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/?from=io). Some email clients don't support the icons from Font Awesome as expected.
